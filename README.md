Exploratory Data Analysis of Genomic Data Set

The objective of this project was to analyze pathogenic mutations, focusing on their distribution across different chromosomes, and their association with specific genes and diseases. This involved cleaning and isolating mutations based on clinical significance criteria and then dividing the analysis by chromosome to better understand the genetic landscape. The aim was to identify key genes and genomic regions with a high mutation burden, providing valuable insights for further research and potential investment opportunities. By delving into specific genomic locations and associated diseases, the project aimed to guide future efforts in understanding genetic predispositions and developing targeted interventions. Ultimately, the goal was to leverage this analysis to inform strategic decision-making and resource allocation within the company.
